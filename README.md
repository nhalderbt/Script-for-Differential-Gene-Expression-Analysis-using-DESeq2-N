# Script-for-Differential-Gene-Expression-Analysis-using-DESeq2-N

This script uses the DESeq2 package in R to perform differential gene expression (DGE) analysis. The goal is to identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed between two conditions (e.g., treated vs untreated) by analyzing count data from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments.
